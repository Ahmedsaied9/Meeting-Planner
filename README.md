# Meeting-Planner
This project focuses on the implementation of a meeting planner using binary search tree. The planner saves meetings in the form meeting title, meeting day, and meeting hour. Meeting title is a string of letters, special characters, numbers, etc. Meeting day is an integer from 1 to 365. Meeting hour is an integer from 0 to 23.
